This project was made as a part of our Final Year Project "Development of a Cyclo-Rotor for UAV Scale Application". 
The aim of our project is to provide a proper computational framework for performance analysis of "CAM" based cyclo-rotors.

Project consists of 3 pillers which are,
  1. Develoment of a aerodynamic Model using BEM theory. (Blade Element-Momentum Theory)
  2. Converting the aerodynamic model into a software for the ease of the analysis.
  3. Validation of programme results using a fabricated test cyclo-rotor setup.
